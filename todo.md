* pvp/pve
  - injury to different body parts
  - some injuries where you bleed out
  - different length to when you die depending on injuries and where they are
* animals

* Load tiles from disk when needed (or auto-generate based on seed)
  and deallocate tiles that aren't needed.
  - Ensures memory size doesn't get bigger than needed
  - Also allows for infinite worlds
* History system
  - Use 'back' command to go back to where you were before last move
  - List of last few moves you've made - limit because humans have limited memory
